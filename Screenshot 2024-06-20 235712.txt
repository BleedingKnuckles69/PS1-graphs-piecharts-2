The image you sent me is titled "Fils VS DIIS IN FY23" and it appears to be a bar graph that shows the net flow of foreign investment into and out of India in the fiscal year 2023 (FY23). The y-axis is labeled "Net Flow (₹ crore)" and the x-axis lists the months from April 2022 to March 2023. 

The net flow is represented by two bars stacked on top of each other for each month. The bottom bar is labeled "FPI Flow" and the top bar is labeled "Dil Flow".  FPI stands for Foreign Portfolio Investment and DII stands for Domestic Institutional Investment.  A positive value on the y-axis indicates a net inflow of money into India, and a negative value indicates a net outflow of money.

Here are the specific values for each month, in ₹ crore:

* April 2022: FPI Flow -₹34,332, DII Flow ₹8,236, Net Flow -₹26,096
* May 2022: FPI Flow -₹18,215, DII Flow ₹14,301, Net Flow -₹3,914
* June 2022: FPI Flow ₹88,122, DII Flow ₹12,135, Net Flow ₹75,987

* January 2023: FPI Flow ₹13,214, DII Flow ₹43,223, Net Flow ₹30,009
* February 2023: FPI Flow ₹20,130, DII Flow ₹31,043, Net Flow ₹10,913
* March 2023: FPI Flow ₹12,962, DII Flow ₹38,671, Net Flow ₹25,709

The chart shows that there was a net outflow of foreign capital from India for the first five months of FY23, with the largest outflow occurring in April 2022.  However, there was a net inflow of foreign capital for the remaining seven months of FY23.  The largest net inflow occurred in June 2022. 

Looking at the FPI and DII flows separately, we can see that the FPI flow was negative for eight months of FY23, and positive for only four months.  The DII flow, on the other hand, was positive for all twelve months of FY23.  This suggests that domestic investors were more confident in the Indian stock market than foreign investors during FY23.

Overall Summary: 
The bar graph titled "Fils VS DIIS IN FY23" depicts the net flow of foreign investment into and out of India in fiscal year 2023 (FY23). There was a net outflow of foreign capital for the first five months of the year, but a net inflow for the remaining seven months.
