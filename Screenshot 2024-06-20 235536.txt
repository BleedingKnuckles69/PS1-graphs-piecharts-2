It is important to note that the chart title “Our performance in numbers” suggests that these metrics are positive indicators of performance, but without additional context it is difficult to say for certain. An increase in ADTO could indicate that customers are trading more frequently, but it could also indicate that order sizes are decreasing. Market share is a useful metric for comparing performance to competitors, but without knowing the overall market size and trends, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the company’s performance.
