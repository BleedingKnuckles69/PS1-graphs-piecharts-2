The pie chart reveals the composition of recycled raw materials used in crumb rubber production for AMEA (Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Africa) and Europe during fiscal year FY23. Crumb rubber, a recycled material derived from used tires and other rubber products, forms the bulk of the raw materials at 57%.

* Following crumb rubber is Chlorobutyl Reclaim (26%), signifying a substantial use of reclaimed chlorobutyl rubber, a specific type of synthetic rubber commonly used in tires and hoses.
* Butyl Reclaim (5%) and NR Reclaim (5%) collectively contribute a smaller portion of the raw materials, indicating a lower reliance on reclaimed butyl and natural rubber in crumb rubber production.
* Ultrafine Reclaim accounts for a mere 2% of the raw materials, suggesting minimal use of this specific type of recycled rubber with very fine particles.

**Inferred insights:**

The data suggests a strong preference for crumb rubber and reclaimed chlorobutyl rubber in crumb rubber production for AMEA and Europe. This could be due to factors such as cost-effectiveness, availability, or specific performance characteristics of these materials. The minimal use of Ultrafine Reclaim might be due to its properties or niche applications in crumb rubber production.

**Overall Summary**

An analysis of the pie chart demonstrates that crumb rubber (57%) and Chlorobutyl Reclaim (26%) are the dominant recycled raw materials used in crumb rubber production for AMEA and Europe in FY23. This suggests a focus on cost-effective and potentially high-performance recycled materials. It is important to consider the environmental and economic benefits of using these recycled materials compared to virgin rubber in crumb rubber production.
