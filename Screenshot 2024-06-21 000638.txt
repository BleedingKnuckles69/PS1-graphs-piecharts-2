The pie chart reveals the utilization of recycled water within a specific operational area (APMEA) for a particular year (FY23). It indicates that 44% of the total annual water withdrawal, which amounted to 2,063,744 cubic meters (m3), was recycled or reused during the reporting period. This suggests a significant effort towards water conservation through recycling practices.
