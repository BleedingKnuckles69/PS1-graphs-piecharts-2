    % of Renewable Energy (RE) in Total Power Generation:
        2018: 0.7%
        2019: 0.8%
        2020: 1.4%
        2021: 2.7%
        2022-23: 3.1%

    The percentage of renewable energy in total power generation has shown a consistent upward trend over the years. From 2018 to 2022-23, the percentage has increased significantly from 0.7% to 3.1%. This indicates a growing reliance on renewable energy sources for power generation, reflecting efforts to transition towards sustainable energy.

    % of Renewable Energy (RE) in Total Energy Consumed:
        2018: 0.0%
        2019: 0.4%
        2020: 0.1%
        2021: 1.1%
        2022-23: 1.3%

    The percentage of renewable energy in total energy consumed has also shown an upward trend, although with more fluctuations compared to power generation. The values rose from 0.0% in 2018 to 1.3% in 2022-23. This suggests an increasing integration of renewable energy in overall energy consumption, though at a slower pace compared to its role in power generation.

Overall Summary:
The data reflects a positive trend in the adoption of renewable energy, both in terms of power generation and energy consumption. The consistent increase in the percentage of renewable energy in power generation highlights a significant shift towards sustainable practices. The increase in renewable energy consumption, though less steep, suggests a gradual but steady move towards incorporating more renewable sources in the overall energy mix. These trends underline a broader commitment to environmental sustainability and energy efficiency.
