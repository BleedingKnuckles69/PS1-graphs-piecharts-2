The bar chart depicts the major contributors to specialty chemicals exports and imports in India in 2010, according to a report by McKinsey & Company titled, "India: The next chemicals manufacturing hub," published in March of 2023. [1]

**Exports**

* Dyes & pigments account for the largest portion of specialty chemicals exports at 40%.
* Following that is Agrochemicals at 19%.
* Flavors & fragrances, Food & feed additives, and Cosmetic chemicals each contribute around 5% to 7% of exports.
* The remaining 18% is classified as "Others".

**Imports**

* Dyes & pigments make up the biggest share of specialty chemicals imports at 36%.
* Agrochemicals follow closely behind at 26%.
* "Others" account for 18% of imports.
* Flavors & fragrances, Food & feed additives, and Cosmetic chemicals each contribute a smaller amount, ranging from 5% to 9% of imports.

**Overall Summary**

In 2010, dyes and pigments were the most prevalent category of specialty chemicals both imported and exported by India. This suggests that India possessed a strong capability for producing dyes and pigments domestically, but also had a need to import them. Agrochemicals were another significant category, indicating a requirement for these products in India’s agricultural sector, but also a domestic capacity to produce them. Overall, the data implies that India’s specialty chemicals sector in 2010 was characterized by a mix of import dependence and domestic production capabilities. 

It is important to note that the data provided is for the year 2010 and may not reflect the current state of India’s specialty chemicals industry. The McKinsey report itself is from 2023, so it is likely that the authors looked at data from 2010 to provide a historical perspective.
