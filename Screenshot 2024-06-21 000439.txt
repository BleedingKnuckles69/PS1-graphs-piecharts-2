The pie chart illustrates the annual group average AMR compliance score, in a healthcare setting, from FY 2012-2023. AMR stands for Antimicrobial Resistance, and a compliance score likely reflects adherence to protocols for prescribing antibiotics and other antimicrobial drugs. The data suggests a significant improvement in AMR compliance over the past decade. While the specific scores aren't visible from the description, it seems the compliance scores have risen from a base level in FY 2012-2013 to a higher level in FY 2022-2023. This could indicate a positive trend in antibiotic stewardship practices within this group.
