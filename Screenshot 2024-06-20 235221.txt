This chart illustrates the average dust specific concentration, expressed in grams per tonne of cementitious material, from 2018 to the fiscal year 2022-23. In 2018, the dust concentration was 22 g/tonne. This value decreased to 16 g/tonne in 2019, indicating early improvements in dust control measures. However, in 2020, there was an increase to 23 g/tonne, suggesting possible operational challenges or changes in production processes. The concentration then decreased again to 17 g/tonne in 2021, and further dropped to 14 g/tonne in 2022-23, marking the lowest level in the observed period. This overall trend signifies effective dust management strategies and advancements in controlling particulate emissions.

Overall Summary: The chart shows a fluctuating yet overall downward trend in average dust specific concentration from 2018 to 2022-23. Starting at 22 g/tonne in 2018, the concentration decreased to 14 g/tonne in 2022-23, reflecting a 36% reduction over the five years. Despite a temporary increase in 2020, the overall decline highlights improvements in dust control technologies and processes, contributing to better air quality and compliance with environmental standards.
