The chart you sent me is titled "Revenue Contribution by Region" and it appears to be a stacked bar chart that shows the revenue contribution of five regions (North America, Europe, Japan, Singapore and Rest of the World) to a company for the fiscal years FY19, FY20, FY21, FY22 and FY23. 

The y-axis is labeled "%". The x-axis lists the five regions mentioned previously. 

Each bar is divided into sections of different colors, representing the revenue contribution from that region in each fiscal year. For example, the bar for North America has a blue section for FY19, a green section for FY20, and so on. 

Here are some of the specific values that can be extracted from the chart, although the exact values for some sections are difficult to determine due to overlapping colors:

* **North America:** FY19 - appears to be between 32% and 37%, FY20 - appears to be between 28% and 36%, FY21 - appears to be between 15% and 28%, FY22 - appears to be around 6%, FY23 - appears to be around 4%.
* **Europe:** FY19 - appears to be between 26% and 28%, FY20 - not shown, FY21 - appears to be around 15%, FY22 - appears to be between 11% and 12%, FY23 - appears to be 30%.
* **Japan:** FY19 - appears to be between 7% and 12%, FY20 - not shown, FY21 - not shown, FY22 - not shown, FY23 - appears to be 1%.
* **Singapore:** FY19 - appears to be between 7% and 12%, FY20 - appears to be between 0% and 6%, FY21 - appears to be around 42%, FY22 - appears to be between 11% and 15%, FY23 - appears to be 16%.
* **Rest of the World:** FY19 - appears to be between 12% and 17%, FY20 - appears to be between 40% and 42%, FY21 - appears to be around 10%, FY22 - appears to be around 12%, FY23 - appears to be 0.1%

The chart shows a significant shift in revenue contribution from North America and Rest of the World to Europe and Singapore over the five-year period. North America's contribution appears to have declined from over 30% in FY19 to around 4% in FY23.  Europe's contribution appears to have increased from around 26% in FY19 to 30% in FY23. Singapore's contribution appears to have increased from around 7% in FY19 to 16% in FY23. 

It is difficult to say for sure what is causing this trend without more information, but it is possible that the company is focusing its efforts on expanding its business in Europe and Singapore. 

Overall Summary: 
The chart titled "Revenue Contribution by Region" shows a significant shift in the revenue contribution of five regions to a company over a five-year period. The contribution from North America and Rest of the World appears to have declined, while the contribution from Europe and Singapore appears to have increased. This suggests that the company is focusing its efforts on expanding its business in new markets.
