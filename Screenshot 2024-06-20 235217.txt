This chart tracks the average NOx (Nitrogen Oxides) specific concentration measured in grams per tonne of cementitious material from 2018 to the fiscal year 2022-23. Starting in 2018, the NOx concentration was recorded at 1,111 g/tonne. Over the following years, there is a noticeable decrease, with the values dropping to 850 g/tonne in 2019 and 811 g/tonne in 2020. This downward trend continues into 2021, where the concentration further reduced to 596 g/tonne. The most significant drop is observed in the fiscal year 2022-23, reaching the lowest value of 524 g/tonne. This consistent reduction suggests ongoing efforts to mitigate NOx emissions, reflecting improvements in environmental performance and adherence to stricter emission standards.

Overall Summary: The chart highlights a consistent and substantial reduction in the average NOx specific concentration from 2018 to 2022-23. This decline from 1,111 g/tonne in 2018 to 524 g/tonne in 2022-23 signifies a nearly 53% reduction over the five-year period. The trend suggests effective measures and technological advancements aimed at reducing NOx emissions in cement production, underscoring the companyâ€™s commitment to environmental sustainability and regulatory compliance.
