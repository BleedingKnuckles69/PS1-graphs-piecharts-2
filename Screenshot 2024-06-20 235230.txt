This chart presents the thermal energy efficiency, measured in kilocalories per kilogram of clinker, from 2018 to the fiscal year 2022-23. In 2018 and 2019, the energy efficiency was stable at 760 kCal/Kg. There was a slight increase in 2020, with the value reaching 769 kCal/Kg, indicating a marginal decline in energy efficiency. However, in 2021, the efficiency improved, dropping to 746 kCal/Kg. The fiscal year 2022-23 shows a further improvement, with the thermal energy efficiency recorded at 742 kCal/Kg. This trend suggests efforts to enhance energy efficiency in clinker production, reflecting advancements in technology and process optimization.

Overall Summary: The chart indicates an overall improvement in thermal energy efficiency from 2018 to 2022-23, with the efficiency increasing from 760 kCal/Kg to 742 kCal/Kg of clinker. Despite a slight rise in 2020, the downward trend in energy consumption per kilogram of clinker demonstrates the companyâ€™s commitment to energy conservation and sustainable production practices. These improvements contribute to reduced operational costs and lower environmental impact, aligning with broader sustainability goals and energy efficiency standards.
