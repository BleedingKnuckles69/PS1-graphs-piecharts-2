The chart you sent me is titled "IPO Activity" and it shows the number of initial public offerings (IPOs) and the total proceeds from those IPOs over a three-year period, likely fiscal years (FY) 2021, 2022 and 2023. The y-axis labeled "Number of IPOs" starts at 0 and goes up to 120 with major tick marks at intervals of 20. The x-axis labeled "IPO (US$ mn)" starts at 0 and goes up to 18,000 with major tick marks at intervals of 4,000. 

The data for the number of IPOs is represented by a blue bar chart and the data for the total proceeds from IPOs is represented by a green line graph. 

Here are the specific values that can be extracted from the chart:

* FY21: Number of IPOs - 40, Proceeds - $6,000 million (US$ mn)
* FY22: Number of IPOs - 80, Proceeds - $14,000 million (US$ mn)
* FY23: Number of IPOs - 120, Proceeds - $18,000 million (US$ mn)

The chart shows a steady increase in both the number of IPOs and the total proceeds from IPOs over the three-year period. The number of IPOs has tripled from 40 in FY21 to 120 in FY23. The total proceeds from IPOs has also tripled from $6,000 million in FY21 to $18,000 million in FY23. 

It is difficult to say for sure what is causing this trend without more information, but it is possible that a strong economy and a bullish stock market are encouraging companies to go public. 

Overall Summary: 
The chart titled "IPO Activity" shows a significant increase in the number of initial public offerings (IPOs) and the total proceeds from those IPOs in India over a three-year period. The number of IPOs tripled from 40 in FY21 to 120 in FY23, and the total proceeds from IPOs also tripled from $6,000 million to $18,000 million over the same period.
