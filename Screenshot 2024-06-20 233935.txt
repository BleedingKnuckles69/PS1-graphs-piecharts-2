Overall summary: 
The bar chart depicts a gender imbalance in a company’s workforce. Men significantly outnumber women as employees. There is no information available to explain the reasons behind this imbalance. It could be due to company policies, societal norms, or the industry itself. 
 
Some companies  have instituted policies aimed at achieving gender balance in their workforce. These efforts may include outreach programs to recruit women in STEM fields or unconscious bias training for hiring managers.
